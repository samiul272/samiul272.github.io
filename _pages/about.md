Hi there! I am a PhD. candidate at Michigan State University. I work on improving privacy and fairness in deep learning. I used to work at Samsung Research and Development Institute in Bangladesh as a Software Engineer till 2021. I graduated from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2017. 

I am one of the co-founders of bengali.ai. I lead the collection and standardisation efforts behind popular open source Bengali Natural Language and OCR Datasets like NumtaDB, Bengali Graphemes and Common Voice Bengali Speech Dataset.

I am deeply passionate about my work and regularly try and find novel applications. As such, I have worked in a wide range of applications. If you have any questions about my research or have any relevant ideas in mind, feel free to e-mail me.

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
